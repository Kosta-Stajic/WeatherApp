# WeatherApp 🌦️

A simple weather application built to practice asynchronous JavaScript, including async/await, Promises, and working with external APIs.

The app allows users to search for a city and view current weather conditions in real time.

🧠 What I’m Practicing in This Project

This project is mainly focused on improving my understanding of:

async / await

Promises and .then() vs await

Fetching data from REST APIs

Error handling with try / catch

Working with JSON responses

Structuring async logic cleanly
